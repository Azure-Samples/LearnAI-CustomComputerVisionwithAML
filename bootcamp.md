# Welcome

In this workshop, we will focus on hands-on activities that simplify the end-to-end experience of developing custom models for Computer Vision in Azure Machine Learning.

Some prior knowledge about linear algebra, calculus, probability and statistics would definitely be a plus but its not required. The labs will use python code for demonstrating the various scenarios in Computer Vision.


# Pre-requisites

Pre-requisites can be found [here](bootcamp-pre-requisites/0_README.md). Briefly, pre-requisites include the following:

## Resources

- The ability to create resources within an Azure subscription
- Familiarity with how to create resources in said subscription

## Azure Machine Learning Workbench

- Python Proficiency and familiarity with Azure Machine Learning Workbench's end-end features including deployment.

## AML Package for Computer Vision

- To download and install the packages, follow the instructions in the [pre-requisites](bootcamp-pre-requisites/0_README.md).


## Languages

- Python

# Goals

*Azure ML Package for Computer Vision*

- Understand how to ingest an image dataset
- Understand how you can perform dataset augmentation
- Build models for image classification, image similarity and object detection
- Understand how to evaluate the models
- Deploy trained models to Azure
