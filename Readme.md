# Welcome

> **NOTE** This content is no longer maintained. Visit the [Azure Machine Learning Notebook](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks) project for sample Jupyter notebooks for ML and deep learning with Azure Machine Learning.

In this workshop, we will focus on hands-on activities that simplify the end-to-end experience of developing custom models for Computer Vision in Azure Machine Learning.

Some prior knowledge about linear algebra, calculus, probability and statistics would definitely be a plus but its not required. The labs will use python code for demonstrating the various scenarios in Computer Vision.


# Pre-requisites

Pre-requisites can be found [here](bootcamp-pre-requisites/0_README.md). Briefly, pre-requisites in the following categories include:

  _Resources_

  - The ability to create resources within an Azure subscription
  - Familiarity with how to create resources in said subscription

  _Azure Machine Learning Workbench_

  - Python Proficiency and familiarity with Azure Machine Learning Workbench's end-end features including deployment

  _AML Package for Computer Vision_

  - To download and install the packages, follow the instructions in the [pre-requisites](bootcamp-pre-requisites/0_README.md).

  _Languages_

  - Python

# Goals

*Azure ML Package for Computer Vision*

- Understand how to ingest an image dataset
- Understand how you can perform dataset augmentation
- Build models for image classification, image similarity and object detection
- Understand how to evaluate the models
- Deploy trained models to Azure
